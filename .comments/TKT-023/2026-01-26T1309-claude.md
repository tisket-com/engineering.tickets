Implemented the fix:

**Changes:**
- `client/src/lib/repos.ts`: Added `getRepos()` (DB-only) and `syncReposFromGitHub()` (explicit sync)
- `client/src/trpc/routers/repos.ts`: Changed `repos.list` to use `getRepos()`, added `repos.sync` mutation
- `client/src/components/workspace-context.tsx`: Added `syncFromGitHub()` method for UI access

**How it works:**
- Normal page loads now query the database directly via `getRepos()`
- When MCP creates a repo, it inserts into the DB, so it appears immediately
- `syncFromGitHub()` can be called explicitly to discover new repos from GitHub
