# TKT-005: Implement Kanban board view

## Overview
Add a Kanban-style board view for visualizing tickets. Each board is a separate `.board.yaml` file that defines columns and ticket placement. The renderer fetches ticket metadata (status, priority, assignee) from the actual ticket files.

## Requirements
- Multiple boards per team repo (one file per board)
- Drag-and-drop moves ticket ID between columns in the YAML
- Renderer shows ticket metadata from ticket files
- Optional WIP limits per column
- Sprint support with date ranges

## Resolution
Implemented status-driven board model where columns are derived from ticket statuses. See TKT-014 for follow-up work.

Consider storing board configuration as a YAML file in the repo (e.g., `.kanban.yaml`) instead of localStorage. This would make column order, WIP limits, and swimlane settings version-controlled and shared across the team.

Testing auto-commit for comments. The board config should be stored as a YAML file in the repo for version control.
