# TKT-018: Rename "Tickets" tab to "Teams"

## Overview
Consider renaming the "Tickets" tab in the sidebar to "Teams" to better reflect the organizational structure.

## Rationale
- The tab shows team-based ticket repositories (e.g., `engineering.tickets`, `marketing.tickets`)
- "Teams" better describes the top-level grouping
- Individual tickets are nested under each team, so the hierarchy would be: Teams → Team → Tickets

## Considerations
- May need to update URL structure (`/workspace/teams/` instead of `/workspace/tickets/`)
- Need to ensure consistent terminology throughout the app
- Consider if this affects user mental model of the product
