# TKT-024: Sidenav improvements

Improvements to the tickets sidenav:

## Text overflow with ellipsis
Ticket titles now truncate with ellipsis when the sidenav is narrower than the text. Added `overflow-hidden` to Link, ScrollArea viewport, CollapsibleContent, and inner containers in `workspace-sidebar.tsx`.

## Order tickets by ID (newest first)
Tickets are now sorted by ticket ID descending (TKT-024 before TKT-001) so newest tickets appear first. Implemented in `workspace-sidebar-live.tsx`.

## Skeleton loading state
Added skeleton placeholder while tickets are loading, with 200ms delay to prevent flash on fast loads.

## Fix highlight flashing
Fixed bug where ticket change indicators would flash between colors on SSE reconnection. Added commit OID tracking in `use-realtime-events.ts` to skip already-processed commits.
