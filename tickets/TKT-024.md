# TKT-024: Sidenav improvements: text overflow and ticket ordering

Two improvements needed for the sidenav:

## 1. Text overflow with ellipsis
Currently ticket titles in the sidenav can overflow beyond the nav width. Should show ellipsis when the nav is narrower than the text, similar to how the timeline section already handles this.

## 2. Order tickets by last modified
Tickets in the sidenav should be ordered by when they were last modified (most recently modified first), not by ticket ID or alphabetically.
