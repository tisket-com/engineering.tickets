# TKT-024: Sidenav improvements: text overflow and ticket ordering

Two improvements needed for the sidenav:

## 1. Text overflow with ellipsis
Currently ticket titles in the sidenav can overflow beyond the nav width. Should show ellipsis when the nav is narrower than the text, similar to how the timeline section already handles this.

## 2. Order tickets by last modified
Tickets in the sidenav should be ordered by when they were last modified (most recently modified first), not by ticket ID or alphabetically.

> Implemented both improvements:
> 
> 1. **Text overflow with ellipsis**: Added `overflow-hidden` to the Link element in TicketTreeItem component (`workspace-sidebar.tsx:1496`) - the truncate class was already present on the title span but wasn't working because the parent container needed overflow hidden.
> 
> 2. **Order tickets by last modified**: 
>    - Added `lastModified?: number` field to `ParsedTicket` interface
>    - Modified ticket parsing to build a file path -> last modified timestamp map from git commit history
>    - Updated sorting in `buildTicketTreeFromParsed` to sort by `lastModified` (most recent first) instead of priority/alphabetical

> Additional fixes in this scope:
> 
> - Simplified sorting to use ticket ID (newest first) instead of git history - more reliable and performant
> - Added skeleton loading state with 200ms delay to prevent flash
> - Added overflow-hidden to ScrollArea, CollapsibleContent, and inner containers
> - Fixed ticket highlight flashing bug: SSE reconnection was re-processing historical commits causing change type colors to flash through previous states (green→orange). Added commit OID tracking in `use-realtime-events.ts` to skip already-processed commits.
