# TKT-029: Restructure and standardize route naming conventions

## Overview

Restructure the app's routing to follow a consistent, hierarchical naming convention.

## Proposed Route Structure

```
/workspace/projects/<repo_name>/<file_path>
/workspace/teams/<repo_name>/<file_path>
```

## Goals

- Establish clear separation between projects and teams in the URL structure
- Use consistent naming patterns across all routes
- Make URLs more intuitive and predictable
- Support file path navigation within repositories

## Tasks

- [ ] Audit current route structure
- [ ] Design new route hierarchy
- [ ] Update route definitions
- [ ] Update all internal links and navigation
- [ ] Add redirects from old routes if needed
- [ ] Update any documentation referencing routes
