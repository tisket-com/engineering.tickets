# TKT-019: Backlog improvements - virtual backlog file and cleaner UI

## Overview

Improve the backlog experience by making it a virtual feature that works out of the box without requiring configuration files.

## Requirements

### Virtual Backlog File
- The backlog should use the `/tickets` page but display as if it was a file called `backlog` (lowercase) beneath tickets
- Should work as a backlog without requiring a `backlog.yaml` to function
- This ensures the backlog always works at repo creation with zero configuration

### Repo Card Design Improvements
- Right column should be cleaner - remove the background
- Add an "ACTIVE" header with active sprint cards below
- Add a "Completed" header showing the last 4 completed sprint cards
- Top section should be cleaner - no double background

### Drag and Drop
- Users should be able to drag and drop cards directly from the backlog to sprint cards
- No need for selection UI - direct drag and drop interaction
- Reference: There is already an implementation of drag and drop on the board page that can be reused
