# TKT-031: Ticket Sidenav Redesign

## Overview

Redesign the ticket sidenav to improve organization and usability. Instead of showing tickets directly in the sidenav, restructure to show team folders at the root with dedicated ticketing pages inside them.

## Sidenav Structure

- Keep team folders at root level
- Inside each team folder, show pages for ticket management:
  - Sprints
  - Backlog
  - Other views TBD (research Asana, Linear, Jira for best practices)

## Ticket List Page Design

Create a new ticket list page (similar to existing backlog component) with these differences:

### Grouping
- Tickets grouped by **status** (not priority)
- No sprint columns in the main view

### Filter Bar
Each filter gets its own row with a clear button at the end:
- Sprint filter
- Project filter  
- Priority filter
- Status filter
- Assigned/Unassigned toggle

### Flexibility Considerations
- UI should accommodate ticket management systems beyond sprints
- Consider kanban-only workflows
- Consider custom workflow states
- Consider teams that don't use sprints at all

## Research Needed
- Review Asana, Linear, Jira, Monday.com for sidenav organization patterns
- Determine optimal set of pages to include in team folders
- Consider how different teams might customize their views
