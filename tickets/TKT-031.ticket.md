# TKT-031: Ticket Sidenav Redesign

## Overview

Redesign the ticket sidenav to improve organization and usability. Instead of showing tickets directly in the sidenav, restructure to show team folders at the root with dedicated ticketing pages inside them.

## Sidenav Structure

- Keep team folders at root level
- Inside each team folder, show pages for ticket management (see research below)

## Ticket List Page Design

Create a new ticket list page (similar to existing backlog component) with these differences:

### Grouping
- Tickets grouped by **status** (not priority)
- No sprint columns in the main view

### Filter Bar
Each filter gets its own row with a clear button at the end:
- Sprint filter
- Project filter  
- Priority filter
- Status filter
- Assigned/Unassigned toggle

### Flexibility Considerations
- UI should accommodate ticket management systems beyond sprints
- Consider kanban-only workflows
- Consider custom workflow states
- Consider teams that don't use sprints at all

## Research: Competitor Navigation Patterns

### Linear (Best-in-class for dev teams)

**Global/Personal Views:**
- Inbox (notifications, mentions)
- My Issues (4 tabs: Assigned, Created, Subscribed, Activity)

**Per-Team Views:**
- Issues (with hover submenu for All, Active, Backlog)
- Projects
- Cycles (optional - their version of sprints)
- Triage (optional - intake queue for external issues)
- Custom Views (saved filters)

**Key Insights:**
- "My Issues" uses smart "Focus" grouping - shows what to work on first
- Triage is separate from main workflow - issues must be triaged before entering backlog
- Views are filter-based and dynamic
- Keyboard-first navigation (G+I for inbox, G+B for backlog)

### Jira

**Per-Project Views:**
- Board (kanban/scrum view)
- Backlog (sprint planning)
- Active Sprint
- Releases
- Reports
- Issues (list view with filters)
- Components

**Key Insights:**
- Heavy separation between Scrum and Kanban project types
- Multi-project boards lose sidebar context (design flaw to avoid)
- "For You" personalized section with recent items and assigned work
- Reports are first-class citizens in navigation

### Asana

**Personal Views:**
- My Tasks
- Inbox
- My Dashboard
- Saved Search Views

**Per-Team/Project:**
- Projects organized by Team
- Multiple view types per project (List, Board, Timeline, Calendar)

**Key Insights:**
- Recently rolled back a flatter navigation after user complaints
- Users need hierarchy - organizing by Team is critical
- Portfolios (grouping projects) are important for larger orgs

### Monday.com

**Workspace Structure:**
- Homepage (Recents, Content, Permissions tabs)
- Boards (main work items)
- Dashboards
- Workdocs
- Folders/Sub-folders for organization

**Per-Board Views:**
- Kanban
- Gantt
- Calendar
- Workload (capacity planning)

**Key Insights:**
- Favorites pinned at top of sidebar
- Workspace homepage shows recent activity
- Workload view for team capacity is popular

## Recommended Team Sidenav Pages

Based on research, here are recommended pages for team folders:

### Core Pages (Always Show)
1. **All Issues** - Full list view grouped by status
2. **Board** - Kanban view with columns for each status
3. **Backlog** - Unscheduled/future work

### Optional Pages (Team Configurable)
4. **Sprints/Cycles** - For teams using time-boxed iterations
5. **Triage** - Intake queue (for teams receiving external requests)
6. **My Issues** - Personal view filtered to current team

### Future Considerations
- **Reports/Insights** - Velocity, burndown, cycle time
- **Roadmap** - Timeline view of projects/milestones
- **Workload** - Team capacity visualization

## Non-Sprint Workflow Support

For teams not using sprints, the UI should:
1. Hide Sprint/Cycle navigation entirely
2. Replace sprint filters with other groupings (Project, Milestone, Due Date)
3. Consider "Continuous Flow" mode where work moves through statuses without time-boxing
4. Support custom workflow states beyond open/in_progress/resolved/closed

---

## Open Questions
1. Should "My Issues" be team-scoped or global?
2. Do we need a separate Triage workflow or just a status?
3. How do custom views fit in - per team or global?
