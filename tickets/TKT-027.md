# TKT-027: Client Service Desk Architecture - Threads & Email Gateway

## Overview

Architecture decisions for how external clients interact with Tisket as a service desk. This covers the client-facing "threads" model, email integration, and how it bridges to internal ticketing.

---

## Naming Convention

**Decision:** Use "Inboxes" as the container for client threads.

| Concept | Container | Contents |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Documentation | Projects | Markdown files |
| Internal work | Teams | Tickets |
| Client support | **Inboxes** | **Threads** |

**Rationale:**
- Self-describing: an inbox contains threads, obvious
- Email-native: matches the architecture (webhook receives email → thread)
- No jargon: everyone knows what an inbox is
- No namespace collision: "inbox" isn't overloaded in tech (unlike "service", "client", "desk")

**Rejected alternatives:**
- "Desks" → evokes "service desk" but informal
- "Services" → overloaded in tech (microservices, SaaS, cloud services)
- "Clients" → conflicts with "client-side" in tech contexts
- "Accounts" → implies billing/commercial relationship

---

## Inbox Provisioning

When an inbox is created, Tisket automatically provisions a Postmark inbound address:

```
<inbox_name>.<workspace_slug>@tisket.com
```

**Examples:**
- Workspace "acme", inbox "support" → `support.acme@tisket.com`
- Workspace "acme", inbox "billing" → `billing.acme@tisket.com`
- Workspace "globex", inbox "help" → `help.globex@tisket.com`

**Implementation:**
- On inbox creation, call Postmark API to create inbound address
- Store the generated address in the `inboxes` table
- Postmark webhook routes all inbound email to Tisket's single webhook endpoint
- Webhook parses `To` address to identify workspace + inbox

**Constraints:**
- Inbox names must be unique within a workspace
- Inbox names must be valid email local-part characters (lowercase, alphanumeric, hyphens)
- Workspace slugs are already validated for URL safety

**Future: Custom Domains**
Custom domains (Phase 4) would allow `support@clientcorp.com` instead of `support.acme@tisket.com`. The Postmark address remains as a fallback/internal address.

---

## Key Decisions

### 1. Threads vs Tickets (Two Distinct Concepts)

**Decision:** Client-facing interactions are "threads" (simple), internal work is "tickets" (complex).

| Threads (Client-Facing) | Tickets (Internal) |
|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Subject + status + messages | Full workflow |
| Open, in_progress, resolved, closed | Priority, SLA, assignee |
| No internal notes | Internal notes, discussions |
| Simple conversation | Links to other tickets, metadata |

**Rationale:** Clients don't need ticketing complexity. They need a conversation with status. All internal complexity stays in `.tickets` repos.

### 2. Storage Format: HTML (Not Markdown)

**Decision:** Store thread messages as HTML, not markdown.

**Rationale:**
- Emails arrive as HTML
- HTML→Markdown conversion is lossy and complex
- Would require AI to extract actual content from email HTML (quoted replies, signatures, etc.)
- If we're building a UI anyway, it can render HTML
- Git's text-diff benefits don't apply to HTML blobs

### 3. Storage Backend: Database (Not Git)

**Decision:** Threads stored in a database, not git repos.

**Rationale:**
- Git benefits (version history, offline, distributed) don't add much for append-only conversations
- Threads are simple CRUD operations
- Real-time updates easier with database
- HTML content makes git diffs meaningless anyway
- Database is the right tool for this job

**Note:** Internal `.tickets` repos remain git-based (markdown, version history matters).

### 4. Email Integration: Webhook Model

**Decision:** Use email provider webhooks (Postmark, SendGrid, etc.) for inbound email.

**Rejected alternatives:**
- Platform-provided address (`@platform.com`) - unprofessional
- Email forwarding - breaks SPF/DKIM, adds latency
- IMAP/OAuth polling - complex setup, polling delays

**Webhook advantages:**
- Real-time (no polling)
- Email parsing handled by provider
- Low ops burden
- Works with custom domains

### 5. Email Threading Mechanism

**Decision:** Use subject line `[THD-xxx]` as the primary threading mechanism.

**Implementation:**
- Outbound emails include thread ID in subject: `[THD-001] Subject`
- Generate unique `Message-ID` header, store in database
- Inbound replies matched by parsing `[THD-xxx]` from subject

**Why not header-based matching (In-Reply-To/Message-ID)?**

Investigated whether email add-ons could use `Message-ID`/`In-Reply-To` headers instead of modifying the subject. Both Gmail Add-ons and Outlook Add-ins do have access to these headers:
- Gmail: `message.getHeader('Message-ID')`, `e.messageMetadata.messageId`
- Outlook: `Office.context.mailbox.item.inReplyTo`, `internetHeaders` property

However, since some email clients/servers strip or mangle headers, we'd need the subject line fallback anyway. Building two matching mechanisms adds complexity without benefit. Subject line `[THD-xxx]` is:
- Simpler: one mechanism, not two
- Visible: you can see the thread ID, easier to debug
- Universal: works regardless of header preservation
- Industry standard: how ServiceNow and others do it

**Security:**
- Tokens in thread references prevent guessing
- SPF/DKIM/DMARC verify sending domain
- New threads can require known contacts only

### 6. Custom Domain Support (Multi-tenant)

**Decision:** Support customers using their own email domains.

**Requirements per customer:**
- MX record pointing to email provider
- SPF record authorizing provider
- DKIM CNAME for signatures
- Domain verification in provider

**Implementation:**
- Inbox identification via `To` address on inbound
- Outbound sends `From` customer's domain
- Database scoped by inbox

**Recommendation:** Start with single domain, add custom domains as premium feature.

### 7. No AI Intermediary for Email

**Decision:** Email gateway has no AI processing. Raw email → thread storage.

**The MCP is the bridge:**
- AI agents read threads via MCP
- AI agents create/update internal tickets
- AI agents can draft replies (but humans send via email client)
- MCP handles the mapping, not the email gateway

### 8. Staff Reply Method: Native Email Client + Add-on (UPDATED)

**Decision:** Staff use their normal Gmail/Outlook email clients. A browser add-on appends thread IDs to outbound emails.

**Clarification:** This is a simple database lookup, not AI processing. The add-on:
1. Queries Tisket API for matching thread
2. Appends `[THD-xxx]` to subject if found
3. No email content is read or processed

**Rationale:**
- Staff stay in familiar tools (Gmail, Outlook)
- No need to build a compose UI in Tisket
- Lower friction for adoption
- Tisket becomes read-only for threads internally (view conversations, link to tickets)

**Rejected alternative:**
- Staff compose replies within Tisket UI → Tisket sends email on their behalf
- This would require building email composition, formatting, attachments, etc.

---

## Add-on Architecture (Gmail / Outlook)

### Option A: Gmail Add-on (Recommended for Gmail users)

**Pros:**
- Official Google Apps Script API with `UpdateDraftSubjectAction`
- Works across devices (desktop, mobile Gmail app) when signed into account
- Sandboxed, stable, won't break when Gmail updates UI
- Compose trigger hooks into email composition natively
- Can modify subject, body, recipients via official APIs

**Cons:**
- Requires Google Workspace Marketplace publishing (or internal deployment)
- Apps Script has some latency
- Limited to Gmail users

**Implementation:**
- Define `gmail.composeTrigger` in manifest
- On compose, query Tisket API: "is there a thread for this recipient/subject?"
- If match found, use `UpdateDraftSubjectAction` to append `[THD-xxx]`
- Store Message-ID mapping when email is sent

### Option B: Chrome Extension (Alternative for Gmail)

**Pros:**
- More flexibility (full DOM access)
- Can work on any webmail, not just Gmail
- No marketplace approval needed for internal use

**Cons:**
- Fragile - Gmail DOM changes frequently, requires maintenance
- Desktop browser only (no mobile)
- No official API, relies on reverse-engineering
- Only works in browser where installed

**Not recommended** due to maintenance burden.

### Option C: Outlook Web Add-in (Recommended for Outlook users)

**Pros:**
- Official Microsoft API with compose mode support
- Works across platforms (new Outlook, web, Mac)
- Microsoft phasing out COM add-ins, web add-ins are the future
- Sandboxed, stable
- Easy deployment (no per-machine install)

**Cons:**
- Different codebase from Gmail Add-on
- Requires Microsoft Partner Center for public distribution

**Implementation:**
- Define compose mode activation in manifest
- Hook into compose events
- Query Tisket API for thread matching
- Modify subject field via Office.js API

### Recommendation

Build both **Gmail Add-on** and **Outlook Web Add-in** using their official APIs. Share the Tisket API integration logic, keep platform-specific code separate.

## Data Model

### Threads (Database)

```sql
CREATE TABLE inboxes (
  id              TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  workspace_id    TEXT NOT NULL,
  name            TEXT NOT NULL,           -- e.g. "support"
  email_address   TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,    -- e.g. "support.acme@tisket.com"
  custom_domain   TEXT,                    -- e.g. "support@clientcorp.com" (Phase 4)
  created_at      TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(workspace_id, name)
);

CREATE TABLE threads (
  id            TEXT PRIMARY KEY,   -- THD-001
  inbox_id      TEXT REFERENCES inboxes(id),
  subject       TEXT,
  status        TEXT,               -- open, in_progress, resolved, closed
  client_email  TEXT,
  client_name   TEXT,
  created_at    TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at    TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE messages (
  id            TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  thread_id     TEXT REFERENCES threads(id),
  message_id    TEXT,               -- Email Message-ID header
  direction     TEXT,               -- inbound, outbound
  from_address  TEXT,
  body_html     TEXT,
  created_at    TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE attachments (
  id            TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  message_id    TEXT REFERENCES messages(id),
  filename      TEXT,
  content_type  TEXT,
  storage_path  TEXT                -- S3/R2 path
);
```

### Internal Ticket Link

```yaml
# In engineering.tickets/TKT-042.md
---
status: in_progress
priority: high
assignee: "@sarah"
client_thread:
  inbox: acme-support
  thread_id: THD-001
---
```

---

## MCP Tools Needed

```typescript
// Inbox operations
list_inboxes(workspace_id?)
get_inbox(inbox_id)
create_inbox(workspace_id, name)  // provisions Postmark address

// Thread operations (read-only, used by AI agents via MCP)
list_threads(inbox_id, status?)
get_thread(thread_id)
update_thread_status(thread_id, status)

// Linking
link_thread_to_ticket(thread_id, ticket_id)
get_ticket_for_thread(thread_id)

// Add-on API (called by Gmail/Outlook add-on, simple DB lookup)
find_thread_for_email(recipient_email, subject)
// Returns thread_id if match found, null otherwise
```

**Note:** `reply_to_thread()` removed - staff reply via their email client, not MCP.

---

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Email Gateway
- Webhook endpoint for inbound email
- Inbox/thread/message storage (database)
- Inbox provisioning (auto-create Postmark address)
- Basic threading (subject line parsing)
- Thread API for add-on queries

### Phase 2: Gmail/Outlook Add-ons
- Gmail Add-on (Apps Script)
- Outlook Web Add-in (Office.js)
- Thread lookup API integration
- Subject line injection on compose

### Phase 3: Tisket Thread Viewer
- Internal tab to view threads (read-only)
- Link threads to internal tickets
- Filter by status, inbox, date

### Phase 4: Multi-inbox / Custom Domains
- Per-inbox configuration
- Custom domain onboarding flow
- Domain verification

### ~~Phase 3: Client Portal (Deprioritized)~~
~~- Web UI for clients to view their threads~~
~~- Direct message submission (no email)~~
~~- File upload/download~~

**Note:** Client portal deprioritized. Clients use email. Internal team views threads in Tisket.

---

## Open Questions

1. **Attachment storage:** S3/R2 vs database blobs?
2. ~~**Thread portal:** Build custom or use existing solution?~~ → Deprioritized
3. **Real-time:** WebSockets for live thread updates in Tisket viewer?
4. ~~**Email provider:** Postmark vs SendGrid vs others?~~ → Postmark
5. **Add-on distribution:** Internal only, or publish to marketplaces?
