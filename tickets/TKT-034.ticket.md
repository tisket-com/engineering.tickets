# TKT-034: Replace payrun sidebar navigation with horizontal tabs

Replace the payrun sidebar navigation (`SecondarySidebar`) with horizontal tabs matching the employee page pattern (`employee-tabs.tsx`).

**Changes:**
- Created `payrun-tabs.tsx` component with header (back link, payrun name, pay date/frequency/paygroup subtitle) and 3 always-visible tabs (HR Changes, Payrun, Payments)
- Unreached stages render as disabled tabs (not clickable, visually dimmed)
- Updated `layout.tsx` to use centered `max-w-5xl` layout with `PayrunTabs` instead of `SecondarySidebar`
- Removed `getPayrunItems()` from `lib/navigation.ts`

> Moved Draft/Posted status badge and payrun metadata (pay date, frequency, paygroup) from individual page headers into the shared payrun-tabs component. Removed duplicate header sections from review-payroll and posted-payroll. Cleaned up unused imports.
