# TKT-021: Evaluate GitHub App implementation for improved rate limits

## Summary

Investigate migrating from OAuth user tokens to GitHub App installation tokens for improved API rate limits and better multi-tenant scaling.

## Background

Currently Tisket uses OAuth user tokens for GitHub API access. This has rate limit implications:
- REST API: 5,000 requests/hour per user token
- All MCP server operations share the authenticated user's quota

## What GitHub Apps Would Improve

### REST API Rate Limits
- Base: 5,000 requests/hour per installation
- Scales: +50 req/hour per repo (max 12,500)
- Scales: +50 req/hour per org user (max 12,500)
- Each org installation gets its own rate limit pool
- GitHub Enterprise Cloud: 15,000 requests/hour

### Multi-tenant Benefits
- Rate limits isolated per organization
- One org's heavy usage doesn't affect others
- Better scaling as user base grows

## What GitHub Apps Would NOT Change

### Git Protocol Operations
- `clone`, `fetch`, `push`, `listServerRefs` limits unchanged
- These are per-repository (~15 ops/second/repo), compute-based
- Not tied to authentication method
- Already generous for Tisket's use case (small repos, incremental fetches)

## Implementation Considerations

### Required Changes
1. Create and register a GitHub App
2. Implement app installation flow (user installs app on their org)
3. Manage installation access tokens (short-lived, need refresh)
4. Update MCP server to authenticate as installation, not user
5. Handle multiple installations (one per org)

### Trade-offs
| Aspect | OAuth (Current) | GitHub App |
|--------|-----------------|------------|
| Setup complexity | Simple | More complex |
| User experience | Single OAuth flow | Must install app on org |
| Rate limits | Per-user, fixed | Per-installation, scales |
| Token management | Long-lived | Short-lived, needs refresh |
| Permissions | User's full access | Scoped to app permissions |

### Security Benefits
- Scoped permissions (only what app needs)
- Tokens are installation-scoped, not user-scoped
- Better audit trail (actions attributed to app)

## Questions to Resolve
- Do we need both OAuth (for user identity) AND GitHub App (for repo access)?
- How to handle the installation flow in the UI?
- Token refresh strategy for MCP server?
