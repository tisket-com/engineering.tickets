# TKT-030: Unify projects and ticketing into single repo type with tickets directory

Currently there are separate repo types for projects and ticketing teams. This proposal combines them into a single repo type where:

- Each repo can optionally have a `tickets/` directory
- Users would still see tickets through the existing ticketing tab UI
- Simplifies the mental model - no need for separate "team" vs "project" concepts
- A repo is just a repo, with optional ticketing capabilities

## UI Changes

**Sidenav (emulating Asana-style navigation):**
- Show relevant boards and information for the selected repo
- Include backlogs, sprints, and other board views
- Clean navigation focused on ticket management workflows

**Ticket List View:**
- Backlog-style list view for browsing tickets
- Group/separate tickets by **status** (not priority)
- Similar to Asana's list view experience

## Considerations
- Migration path for existing team repos (`.tickets` suffix)
- How to handle the context switching in MCP tools
- UI changes needed to detect and display tickets from the directory
- Schema validation for ticket files in the new location
