Started looking into this. I think we should use a fuzzy search library like Fuse.js for the client-side implementation.

For server-side, we could index tickets in Redis or just do a simple grep through the markdown files.

Fuse.js sounds good for now. We can always add a proper search backend later if needed.

Should we also search within comments? That could be useful for finding past discussions.
