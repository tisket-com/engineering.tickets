# TKT-020: Organize sprints into a sprints/ directory with active sprint surfacing

## Overview

Refactor sprint board storage to use a dedicated `sprints/` directory structure instead of storing sprint `.board.yaml` files in the repository root.

## Requirements

### Directory Structure
- All sprint board files should be stored in a `sprints/` subdirectory (e.g., `sprints/sprint-12.board.yaml`)
- Active sprints should appear in both:
  - The `sprints/` directory (canonical location)
  - The root directory listing (for quick access/visibility)
- Completed/archived sprints only appear in the `sprints/` directory

### Client Updates
Update the following components to account for this change:

1. **Board code** (`client/src/lib/boards.ts`, `client/src/routes/workspace/boards/`)
   - Update board discovery to look in `sprints/` directory
   - Handle path resolution for sprint boards

2. **Backlog code** (`client/src/components/backlog-*.tsx`, `client/src/routes/workspace/backlog/`)
   - Update sprint selection/display to use new paths
   - Ensure backlog can reference sprints in the new location

3. **Sprint components** (`client/src/components/sprint-sidebar.tsx`)
   - Update to read from `sprints/` directory
   - Show active sprints prominently

4. **Sidenav/Sidebar** (`client/src/components/workspace-sidebar.tsx`, `client/src/components/workspace-sidebar-live.tsx`)
   - Surface active sprints at root level in navigation
   - Show full sprint list under a "Sprints" section

### MCP Updates
Update the MCP server to handle the new structure:

1. **Read operations** (`mcp/src/operations/boards.ts`, `mcp/src/lib/boards.ts`)
   - Board listing should aggregate from both root and `sprints/` directory
   - Active sprint detection logic

2. **Write operations** (`mcp/src/tools/`)
   - `create_board` with sprint dates should write to `sprints/` directory
   - Update board path resolution in all write operations

3. **Tool schemas** (`mcp/src/tools/schemas.ts`)
   - Consider adding a `directory` or `is_sprint` parameter to board creation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Sprint boards are created in `sprints/` directory
- [ ] Active sprints appear in root-level listings
- [ ] Completed sprints only show in `sprints/` directory
- [ ] All existing board/backlog/sprint UI continues to work
- [ ] MCP tools correctly read/write to new locations
- [ ] Backward compatibility for any existing root-level sprint boards
