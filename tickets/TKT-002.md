# TKT-002: Flat Ticket Structure

Implement flat file structure for tickets where status is determined by frontmatter, not directory location.

## Benefits

- Clean git history (status changes are edits, not file moves)
- No merge conflicts from concurrent status changes
- Single source of truth (metadata in frontmatter)
- Files stay in one place forever

## Implementation

- [x] Updated tickets.ts to read status from frontmatter only
- [x] Updated sidebar to group by metadata status
- [x] Created useMultiRepoTicketsParsed hook
- [x] Migrated example tickets to flat structure
- [ ] Test in browser
