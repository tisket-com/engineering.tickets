# TKT-015: Add custom team statuses via team config

## Overview

Allow teams to define their own ticket statuses instead of the hardcoded open/in_progress/resolved/closed.

## Proposed Structure

**Team config file** (`team.yaml` in tickets repo root):
```yaml
statuses:
  - backlog
  - ready
  - in_progress
  - review
  - done
```

## Implementation

### MCP
- [ ] Read team.yaml on repo load
- [ ] Validate ticket status against team's allowed statuses
- [ ] Update `update_ticket` to validate status
- [ ] Add `update_team_config` tool (optional)

### Client
- [ ] Parse team.yaml in browser-git
- [ ] Use team statuses for ticket sidebar grouping
- [ ] Use team statuses for Kanban board columns
- [ ] Status dropdown in ticket editor uses team statuses

### Defaults
- If no team.yaml exists, fall back to: open, in_progress, resolved, closed

## Benefits
- Each team can have its own workflow
- Kanban boards automatically use team statuses
- Consistent status validation
