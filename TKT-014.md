# TKT-014: Complete Kanban board functionality

## Overview

The Kanban board has been implemented with basic viewing and MCP tools, but the architecture should be simplified and features completed.

## Architecture Change: Status-Driven Boards

The current column-based approach has sync issues. Proposed simplification:

**Current (column-driven):**
```yaml
columns:
  - name: Backlog
    tickets: [TKT-001, TKT-002]
  - name: In Progress
    tickets: [TKT-005]
```
- Moving ticket = update board YAML
- Status and column can get out of sync

**Proposed (status-driven):**
```yaml
title: Sprint 1
tickets: [TKT-001, TKT-002, TKT-005]
```
- Columns are derived from ticket statuses (or team config, see TKT-015)
- Each ticket appears in column matching its actual status
- Moving ticket = update ticket's status field
- Always in sync

### Benefits
- Simpler board YAML (just a ticket list)
- No sync issues
- Drag-drop updates ticket file, not board file
- Board becomes a "filtered view" of tickets

## Remaining Work

### Must Have
- [ ] **Refactor to status-driven model** - Remove column-based structure, derive columns from statuses
- [ ] **Drag-and-drop updates ticket status** - Call `update_ticket` on drop instead of `move_ticket`
- [ ] **Remove `move_ticket` MCP tool** - No longer needed with status-driven model

### Should Have
- [ ] **Create board from UI** - Add button in sidebar to create new boards
- [ ] **Delete/archive boards** - Remove boards from UI
- [ ] **Board settings panel** - Edit title, description, show/hide statuses

### Nice to Have
- [ ] **Sprint dates display** - Show sprint progress bar
- [ ] **WIP limit per status** - Optional limits in team config
- [ ] **Ticket quick-add** - Create tickets directly from a column
- [ ] **Filter within board** - Filter by assignee, priority, etc.
