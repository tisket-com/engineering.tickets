# TKT-014: Complete Kanban board functionality

## Overview

The Kanban board has been refactored to use a status-driven architecture. Columns are now derived from ticket statuses rather than being stored in the board YAML.

## Completed

- [x] **Refactor to status-driven model** - Board YAML now stores `tickets: []` and optional `statuses: []`. Columns derived from ticket statuses at render time.
- [x] **Drag-and-drop updates ticket status** - UI calls `update_ticket` on drop (optimistic update in place, MCP integration pending)
- [x] **Replace `move_ticket` with `add_to_board`** - New MCP tool just adds tickets to board list, no column management
- [x] **Backlog board created** - `backlog.board.yaml` with 8 tickets for testing

## New Board Schema

```yaml
title: Backlog
description: All engineering tickets
tickets:
  - TKT-001
  - TKT-002
  - TKT-003
statuses:  # optional - defaults to all statuses
  - open
  - in_progress
sprint:  # optional - makes this a sprint board
  start: 2026-01-20
  end: 2026-02-03
  goal: Complete kanban implementation
```

## Remaining Work

### Should Have
- [ ] **Wire up drag-drop to MCP** - Call `update_ticket` via tRPC when ticket is dragged
- [ ] **Create board from UI** - Add button in sidebar to create new boards
- [ ] **Delete/archive boards** - Remove boards from UI
- [ ] **Board settings panel** - Edit title, description, show/hide statuses

### Nice to Have
- [ ] **Sprint dates display** - Already shows progress bar, could be enhanced
- [ ] **WIP limit per status** - Optional limits in team config
- [ ] **Ticket quick-add** - Create tickets directly from a column
- [ ] **Filter within board** - Filter by assignee, priority, etc.

## Technical Notes
- Board route: `/workspace/boards/$repoSlug/$`
- Client parser: `client/src/lib/boards.ts`
- Component: `client/src/components/kanban-board.tsx`
- MCP tools: `create_board`, `add_to_board`, `remove_from_board`
