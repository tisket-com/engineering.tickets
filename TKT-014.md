# TKT-014: Complete Kanban board functionality

## Overview

The Kanban board has been implemented with basic viewing and MCP tools, but several features need completion.

## Remaining Work

### Must Have
- [ ] **Drag-and-drop saves changes** - Currently `onMoveTicket` logs to console but doesn't call MCP to persist. Need to integrate with `move_ticket` MCP tool or write directly to git.
- [ ] **Board refresh after changes** - After moving a ticket, the board YAML updates but the UI needs to refetch/sync.

### Should Have
- [ ] **Create board from UI** - Add a button in the sidebar or team section to create new boards (currently MCP-only).
- [ ] **Delete/archive boards** - No way to remove boards from UI.
- [ ] **Board settings panel** - Edit title, description, columns, WIP limits.

### Nice to Have
- [ ] **Ticket status sync** - Optionally update ticket status when moved to Done column.
- [ ] **Sprint management UI** - Add/edit sprint dates and goals from the board.
- [ ] **WIP limit enforcement** - Block or warn more prominently when exceeding limits.
- [ ] **Ticket quick-add** - Create tickets directly from a column.
- [ ] **Filter/search within board** - Filter tickets by assignee, priority, etc.

## Technical Notes
- Board route: `/workspace/boards/$repoSlug/$`
- MCP tools: `create_board`, `move_ticket`, `remove_from_board`
- Client parser: `client/src/lib/boards.ts`
- Component: `client/src/components/kanban-board.tsx`
